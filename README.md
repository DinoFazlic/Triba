# Triba
This project is a JavaScript-based grid game that allows users to interact with a grid of points. The objective of the game involves selecting points from the grid, and the game checks if the selected points form a collinear set. Players can switch between different grid sizes (e.g., 8x8) and test their ability to select points that satisfy the game's conditions.

## Features
- Dynamic Grid Size: Players can choose between different grid sizes (8x8, etc.).
- Collinearity Check: The game checks if the selected points are collinear (lie on the same straight line).
- Interactive Gameplay: Users can click on the grid to select points and test their collinearity.
- Responsive Interface: The grid adjusts to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience.
